# Multi-turn conversation with the GitHub Copilot CLI agent. The first question starts
# a CLI session; the follow-up is sent with only the new message and the
# session id, so the agent keeps its context, tool results and plan between
# turns instead of re-reading the whole transcript.
#
# Run it from anywhere:
#   bundle exec ruby examples/02_session.rb
#   examples/02_session.rb
